# Paper-Trade
Paper trading is basically simulating the trading of stocks. So instead of using real money to trade stocks, you can paper trade in order to not risk losing any money. I used the Yahoo Finance API to get information about stocks and it can be found here: https://financequotes-api.com/. When you visit the website you will see the ways to add the API to your project as a dependency. I made a Maven project and added in the dependency in the pom.xml file. My version number is 3.15.0, but if yours is different put your version number instead of mine.
